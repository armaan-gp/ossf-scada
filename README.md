# OSSF SCADA

Web-based SCADA dashboard for the Texas A&M On-Site Sewage Facility.

This repository contains the application used to:
- monitor PLC-connected devices and live property values
- manage alert thresholds and SMS notifications
- configure per-property CSV data recording and export

The project is built with Next.js and TypeScript, with PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM) for persistence.
